    subtitle: ''
    text: "*   ### SOCIAL NETWORK SHARING\n\n    We encourage users to share our content and/or like our profile on popular social media networks. In order to make social sharing accessible, our website utilizes widgets provided directly from the social media networks. Cookies and privacy implications from the social media networks vary and will be dependent on your nominated privacy settings with each social media network. Social sharing buttons will only deploy cookies if you are signed in to that respective social media network at the time of being on our website.\n\n*   ### ANALYTICAL TRACKING\n\n    Our website uses Google Analytics, which allows us to track and compile anonymous visitor statistics. The information collected ranges from simple traffic volume to the type of browser you are using to view our website. This information is valuable to us not just for marketing analysis and quantification, but to improve the usability, security and load speed of our website content. Google Analytics is a popular, secure, flagship webmaster product from Google. The privacy and security of Google Analytics data is a high priority at Google that you can read more about on\_[Google’s Analytics Data Safeguarding page](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html). Google also offers a\_[Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)\_that will allow you to automatically opt-out of all websites that track your activity via Google Analytics. No personal information is collected by Google Analytics.\n\n    We also use\_[Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com/)\_in order to better understand our users’ needs and to optimize this service and experience. Hotjar is a technology service that helps us better understand our users’ experience (e.g. how much time they spend on which pages, which links they choose to click, what users do and don’t like, etc.) and this enables us to build and maintain our service with user feedback. Hotjar uses cookies and other technologies ‌to collect data on our users’ behavior and their devices (in particular, device’s IP address (captured and stored only in anonymized form), device screen size, device type (unique device identifiers), browser information, geographic location (country only), and preferred language used to display our website). Hotjar stores this information in a pseudonymized user profile. Neither Hotjar nor we will ever use this information to identify individual users or to match it with further data on an individual user. For further details, please see Hotjar’s\_[privacy policy](https://www.hotjar.com/legal/policies/privacy).\n\n    You can opt-out to the creation of a user profile, Hotjar’s storing of data about your usage of our site and Hotjar’s use of tracking cookies on other websites by following this\_[opt-out link](https://www.hotjar.com/legal/compliance/opt-out).\n\n*   ### ENQUIRY FORMS\n\n    Our website’s visitors can choose to contact us via forms on our website. In order to prevent spam enquiries, we protect our forms with anti-spam challenges which ensure the visitor is an actual living person, rather than a computer bot or spider.\n\n"
